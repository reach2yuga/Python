#List:
#Mutable: Elements can be changed after creation.
#Memory Usage: Consumes more memory.
#Performance: Slower iteration compared to tuples but better for insertion and deletion operations.
#Methods: Offers various built-in methods for manipulation.


a_tuple = ("Data", "Camp", "Tutorial")
print(a_tuple)  # Output: ('Data', 'Camp', 'Tutorial')

#Tuple:
#Immutable: Elements cannot be changed after creation.
#Memory Usage: Consumes less memory.
#Performance: Faster iteration compared to lists but lacks the flexibility of lists.
#Methods: Limited built-in methods.
